# RAG Implementation Project Task Description

## Project Overview
Create a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation with a web interface for natural language question answering.

## User Requirements
- RAG implementation for question answering
- Web interface to ask questions in natural language
- Display sample questions that can be asked
- Allow selection from sample questions along with user input
- Use documents stored in "~/ea_sample_docs/rag_docs" folder for sourcing information
- Test functionality with sample questions and validate response accuracy
- Use sourced documents for context (not simulated context)

## Validation Requirements
- Verify retrieved content contains comprehensive information, not just snippets
- Ensure AI responses are detailed and based on full document context
- Test with diverse question types (broad concepts, specific details, technical patterns)
- Fix any issues identified during testing
- Ensure sample test returns expected response before moving to next step
- Start development server and launch webapp once frontend is ready
